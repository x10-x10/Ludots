# G2: Light-Heavy Mix Combo

## Overview

A combo system where different button inputs (light vs heavy attack) during combo stages lead to different finishers. Combines sequential progression with branching paths based on input choice.

## User Experience

- Player presses light attack (R1) → enters combo stage 1
- Player presses light attack (R1) again → enters combo stage 2
- At any combo stage, player can press heavy attack (R2) for a different finisher:
  - R2 during stage 1 → heavy finisher A
  - R2 during stage 2 → heavy finisher B
- Each finisher has unique properties and animations

## Implementation

Same as G1, but routing depends on **different InputBindings** + combo_stage tags:

```
R1 (light) → combo_stage:1
R1 (light) with combo_stage:1 → combo_stage:2
R2 (heavy) with combo_stage:1 → heavy_finisher_A (reset combo)
R2 (heavy) with combo_stage:2 → heavy_finisher_B (reset combo)
```

**Key Difference from G1**: Multiple input bindings can query the same combo state, creating branching paths.
