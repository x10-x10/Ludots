# G10: Block Counter

## Overview

A special counterattack that is only available immediately following a successful block. When the player blocks an incoming attack, a short window opens during which a counter ability can be activated. Rewards defensive play with offensive opportunities.

## User Experience

- Player holds block button → enters blocking stance
- Enemy attacks → player successfully blocks
- A brief window opens after block (~0.25-0.5s)
- Player presses attack during the window → executes counter (e.g., riposte, parry strike)
- Player misses the window → attack executes as normal attack instead
- Counter attack typically has bonus properties: guaranteed hit, stun, or extra damage

## Implementation

```
Block ability:
  onActivate: AddTag("blocking")
  onReceiveHit (while blocking):
    → ResponseChain: AddTag("post_block", duration=15-30 ticks) on caster

Counter Attack ability:
  precondition: HasTag("post_block")
  exec: counter animation + damage + stun
  onActivate: RemoveTag("post_block")

Normal Attack ability:
  precondition: NOT HasTag("post_block") [optional]
  exec: standard attack
```

**Routing**: Similar to G9 (dodge attack). Both counter_attack and normal_attack are bound to the attack button. `OrderSubmitter` checks preconditions — if `post_block` tag is present, counter_attack takes priority.

**Block Detection**: The block ability grants a "blocking" tag. When the caster receives damage while "blocking" is active, a ResponseChain on the damage effect adds the "post_block" tag.
